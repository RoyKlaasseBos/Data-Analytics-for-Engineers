In this repository you find the weekly Jupyter Notebooks I showed during the Lab Sessions. Although Github provides a nice preview I highly recommend you to download the files (green button **"Clone or download"**) and play around with it yourself. In order to download single files, open the specific file you want to download, click on **"Raw**" and finally **"Save as"** (right-click). 

Alternatively, learn how to use the version control system called Git (*optional*). For example, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD) YouTube playlist for an introduction to Git and Github.
