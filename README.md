# Data-Analytics-for-Engineers
In this repository you find the weekly Jupyter Notebooks I showed during the Lab Sessions. Although Github provides a nice preview I highly recommend you to download the files (green button **"Clone or download"**) and play around with it yourself. Note that you can only download the whole repository; in other words *no individual files*.
