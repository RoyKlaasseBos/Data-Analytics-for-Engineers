# Data-Analytics-for-Engineers
In this repository you find the weekly Jupyter Notebooks I showed during the Lab Sessions. Although Github provides a nice preview I highly recommend you to download the files (green button **"Clone or download"**) and play around with it yourself. In order to download single files, open the specific file you want to download, click on **"Raw**" and finally **"Save as"** (right-click).
