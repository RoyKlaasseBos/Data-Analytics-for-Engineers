Student assessed,What do you like about the poster? And why? (tops),How could the poster be improved? And why? (tips)
1225986,All the sections well explained and detailed. Layout clearly organised. ,Conclusion could be more detailed and answer the main conclusion for each question
1225986,The layout is great! It is easy to navigate through the poster and the use of colors really helps you understand what part of the poster you're reading and which is related to what.,"I believe the analysis of question 1 could be reduced, so it would take less space. This would allow the box plot underneath to be bigger and more visible."
1225986,"The work done is complete! Not only a really interesting question 1, but also an overall clear explanation of every section ",Maybe making the font bigger 
1245640,Perfect lay-out ,The conlusion lacks information and is not complete
1245640,Fantastic lay-out ,The conclusion is not complete
1245640,"Very nice and attractive layout, makes the poster easy-to-read. Everything is explained in a concise way, this allows for a good understanding of the data and the conclusions in general. ","First of all, a discussion is absent. This would be quite an important thing to add. One small note could also be that the first two tables aren't really clear, maybe two plots would've been more comprehensible."
1247255,Great first question and results are clearly explained. The pro's and con's add definitely more value to the conclusion,The con's of question 2 could have been worked out in the assignment.
1247255,"I like the layout of the poster. The layout is clear and I like how the same color is repeated. I found the first, self chosen, question interesting. I think she clearly motivated here answers.","I would have made the text in black instead of grey, this will improve the readability. And the text conclusions are typed in a very small font, maybe this could have been improved. 
Maybe the second graph (from above), could have been smoothed as the peaks seem somewhat strange"
1247255,Well organized and structured. Context giving introduction. Highlighted main observations. ,"Maybe have the discussion before the conclusion, and explain what her 'movie count' data is. "
1248359,I think the first question is really original and interesting. The design of the poster is also very attracting to the eye. The explanation of the recurrent patterns in the second question is clearly stated ,"I believe that the conclusion of the first question could have been more elaborate, seeking for supporting data that could explain the remarkable observations. "
1248359,Nice layout. Background pictures fill up white spaces and are transparent enough to be able to still read the text.,"The table of question 1 is clarifying, but makes the poster a bit less attractive. Marked points in the discussion could have been dealt with in the conclusion and processed in the results."
1248359,Well organized and clear structure with nice subheadings. ,Could include more about the method and why  a table was chosen upon. Could also have more in the discussions about the results. Could introduce the datasets in the introduction. 
1250817,"The poster is made meaningful by relating to a real-world application. So very nice context references (in introduction, etc.)
- real-world goal (e.g. what day best to play The movie) is then also appropriately related to statistical question","I suppose that The explanation of The approach to answering The question might benefit from a less specific explanation. e.g. instead of referring to The database language (SQL) used, and The intermediate data transformation applied (eg. sort by average gross, then convert to line plot) just explain The data in a conceptual sense."
1250817,i liked the clear layout. the introduction is nice and gets you interested in the poster. questions are clearly stated. also the method in which the data was sorted and visualised is described nicely.,the question that is asked should be answered and not only an advise should be given
1250949,"This poster has a very formal design and a brilliant color scheme was used. In terms of content, it is easily readable and proper explanation was clearly included.","The discussion and conclusion has been grouped per question, which I personally don't like in terms of readability. Other than that, the poster is great."
1250949,"Clear lay-out, nice charts. ",No value assigned at the y-axis at the first chart. 
1253492,"Structured layout, makes the poster very comprehensible. Everything is very concise, this is exactly how a poster should be. Graphs also provide a good answer to the questions","The conclusion + discussion part is very short. It does not provide the necessary discussion (pros and cons etc.) and the conclusion on itself is also not sufficient. Some work can be done on this part, but for the rest it looks good."
1253492,Clear setup and explanation of the excercises,Focus more on a discussion
1258605,Clear layout.  Good summary of the results obtained. ,A bit too much text
1258605,"Question 1 was interesting and well performed, because you can see finely which directerors are most efficient in making money. . ","Just a table with all those numbers is not really appealing, the barchart is clear though"
1260057,"Great layout, and lots of written detail and in depth analysis",Could mention why question 1 is of interest earlier than the conclusion
1260057,I like the layout and the big headings of each part. That makes it easy to understand the poster.,The introduction seems a bit crammed and difficult to read. Violin plot could be more visible.
1260057,The layout is clear ,Inverting question 2 box with the discussion box 
1261290,It is very clear and gets the point accross well,Slightly movie in depth analysis and maybe varying the methods of data visualization
1261290,Layout is clear and organized. Two questions clearly stated on the introduction and poster. Interesting discussion and conclusion.,US should be stated that was excluded in introduction. Graphs colours are a bit agressive.
1261290,"I enjoy the colors used in the poster and the brief, but informing introduction.","I would rearrange the graphs or color code them, because they are kind of confusing in terms of which graph relates to which question."
1265792,"Clear and structured layout
He explained the methods that were applied in the poster
","Add a column 'Profit' in the table for question 1
"
1265792,The poster is well structured,The way of explaining the questions is somewhat vague
1265792,Methods are explained well. Intro. and questions are put forward clearly.,Conclusion lacks overall message. Conclusion is too short. 
1266357,"Well written text, good use of bold and italic letters. Clear separation of the sections",Using other visualizations and less screaming colours. Q1 could be better formulated and worked out.
1266357,"Lay-out is clear, separated colors. Highlighting the keywords. ",Explain why question 1 is relevant to the business of movies. 
1266586,"Describing methods, using clear language and sticks to the criteria of the poster.",Image quality is low. Conclusion of q2 differs from other poster (which is not strictly bad but is interesting).
1266586,I like the simplicity of the design and the color combination. I also like the creativity of question 1.,"The second chart is not very readable, at least text-wise. "
1268244,The green color combines well with the black text and gives the poster a professional layout. The graphs look professional as well. I also like the the thought of using green in the poster as the company is named 'Greenscreen'. ,Some text could be replaced by graphs or pictures. Text/graph (picture) ratio is a little to high. 
1268244,I like the layout of the poster very much. And the introduction is very nice. The method used to analyse the graphs is described clearly. She also reflected well on here own work in the conclusion and discussion part.,"Maybe due to the lack of space, the headlines of the paragraphs are not immediately visible, which makes the poster a little bit less clear. Moreover, the second graph is not very clear, this maybe could have been improved by zooming in on the part of the graph with the peaks. "
1268244,Simple efficient design. The methods are explained with the questions. ,Could have more clear subheadings.
1270532,It is structured and there is a lot of explanations for the questions,The poster was in black and white which made the poster a little unattractive and made the graph harder to interpret
1270532,"layout is clear and structured, everything is explained is explained in great detail and the data therefore becomes very comprehensible. It can clearly be seen that the descriptions and conclusions are really well thought-through.","There really is a lot of text on the poster. This is not only a bit of an overkill of information, but in my opinion it's  also not really according to the concept of a poster. To make it more clear and comprehensible, the descriptions and explanations should be shorter and the conclusion should provide more of a take-away message."
1270532,"Good extensive explanation and clarification of the questions
Good visualisation",I would like to see a profit column for Q1
1271024,"- Clean design; very easy to navigate and looks professional. Concise conclusion adds in clarity.
- Results shown to answer Q.1 are exactly relevant
- Results shown to answer Q.2 are relevant, and adding gross numbers is a nice bonus.
","- Q.1: Presentation of findings has room for improvement: it is not immediately obvious how the findings are ordered; and adding a Budget - Gross or Budget/Gross table would aid visualization and also allow for comparison between films (which, though not "
1271024,"Boxes make it clear which section is meant for what, clear structure, nice visualisations","More explanation of motivation, methods, and a broader explanation. Also a few typos were made, which is a pity. No explanation for question 1."
1272101,"A very appealing looking poster, made to look interesting whilst also still being simple and concise. The structure of the poster is also very simple and therefore easy to read.","I miss the analytical tasks for both questions, furthermore sometimes it would have been nice to get some extra structure in the text parts. As now they are plain paragraphs full of text."
1272101,Clear structure. The plots are easy to read,"The days in the second plot can be ordered chronologically, this makes it easier to see that most profit is made in the weekends"
1278711,"The structure is clear and overall the poster looks nice due to usage of different colours, whilst not looking clutterd or overcreative.","I think the plots for each question are hard to read, furthermore I do not see a clear caption for each question. Finally I miss the analytical tasks for the questions in the poster."
1278711,Question 1 was well performed and you can see that Drama movies stands out.,The plots are not really readable
1284576,"Nice and clear introduction, gives a good overview of the assignment. Attractive layout. ",I think the pieces of text of discussion and conclusion could have been switched around. This would have been a more logical sequence. 
1284576,"Clear introduction which describes the aim of the analysis. The discussion part is very strong, explaining remarkable observations ",Explanation of the method
1284576,I really like the layout of the poster. The poster is very clear in it's layout and is nice to read. She reflected well on here own results in the discussion part. ,I don't have many remarks other than that the first graph could have been improved to improve readability. This could have been improved by including the raster of the graph.
