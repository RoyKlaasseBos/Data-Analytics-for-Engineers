## Data Analytics Bootcamp (2017/2018)
In order to help students better prepare for their final exam an additional session in week 8 has been dedicated to topics they found most challenging such as hypotheses testing (indicated in red below). The set-up of this session was as follows: 
* 10:50 - 11:35 (Exam simulation)
* 11:35 - 11:50 (Break)
* 11:50 - 12:30 (Discussion / Solutions)

The 23 open-ended questions of the practice exam can be found over [HERE](https://the-outlier.typeform.com/to/GnQF0X). Note that the actual exam will consist of multiple choice questions which cover the material from all lectures.

*Good luck with your final exam preparations!*
